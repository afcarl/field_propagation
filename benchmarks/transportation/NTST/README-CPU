 BaBar silicon vertex tracker CPU benchmark
 ------------------------------------------

  In this directory you can find a CPU benchmark test of Geant4 
  based on simulation of the BaBar silicon vertex tracker and 40-layer
  drift chamber. By default the Uniform Magnetic Field of 1.5 tesla is applied.
  The field can be changed to GradientField or Tabulated Solenoid Field.

This test can be run : 
     - for transportation in magnetic field only  
     - with 'predifined' Physics list as QGSP_EMV Physics list
     - with NTST Physics list(Electromagnetic physics only with choice for cuts
       and activation of processes)
       
To select Only Transportation in Magnetic Field you have to define enviromental
variable :
   - NTST : for only transportation process 
  
To select a Physics List you have to define one of the following
environmental variables:
   - LHEP :      for the  LHEP       Physics List;
   - QGSP :      for the  QGSP       Physics List;
   - QGSP_EMV :  for the  QGSP_EMV   Physics List;
   - QGSC :      for the  QGSC       Physics List;
   - FTFP :      for the  FTFP       Physics List;
   - QGSP_BIC :  for the  QGSP_BIC   Physics List;
   - QGSP_BERT : for the  QGSP_BERT  Physics List.
   - NTST:       for the  NTSTPhysicsList Home-made Physics List 
                     with choise of cuts for Energy,Loooping particles

 For example, if you want to use QGSP_EMV Physics List you can
 do:  
                    export QGSP_EMV=1
 or, equivalently:
                    make QGSP_EMV=1

 To build the application, first setup your environmental variables
 (the Bash-shell setup file,  setup.sh , shows an example), and then
 do:
                                make XXX=1
 where "XXX" is the name of the Physics List or NTST, or, equivalently:
                                export XXX=1 ; make
 and you get the executable:
                                $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/testNTST
 and to run it:
                                $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/testNTST bench1.g4
                            
 You can run this application with the following macro file:
   -  bench1.g4 : 1000 events,ONLY Transportation process,
                  Uniform Magnetic Feild of 1.5 tesla.
                  Application has to be build with NTST=1: make NTST=1.
                  Each event consisting of reading B-Babar event
                  from file 'babarevt.out'
                  NB) You can replace the events redden from file by 
                      chooting a single particles as chargedgeantinos.
                      For this you have to use command '/gen/choose gun'
                      and then '/gen/gun/particle ...'.
    - bench2.g4 : 1000 events, each consisting of reading B-Babar event
                   from file 'babarevt.out' with chosen Physics list
                   Uniform Magnetic Field of 1.5 tesla 	
    - bench3.g4 : 1000 events, each consisting of reading B-Babar event
                   from file 'babarevt.out' with chosen Physics list
                   Tabulated Solenoid Field of 1.5 tesla
                   (Simulation of Babar Solenoid) 	             

 The CPU time for this test can be obtained in two ways
 (which should be, more or less, in agreement):
   - Look at the value "User=..." at the end of the running,
     after the line "Run Summary": this is the total time,
     in seconds, for all (1000) events, excluding the 
     initialization.
   - Look at the value " Event user time= ..." at the end of the running
     to have time per event, excluding the initialisation 
   - Use:
            time $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/testNTST bench1.g4
     when launching the program: you would get, at the end
     of the program, the value: "user ..."  which is the 
     total time for all (1000) events, including the 
     initialization.

  In the end of the run you will also have the information about number of
  calls to the field.
  It can be useful to see the reason of the time fluctuations.

  The accuracy of propagation in Field can be changed by commands :
  'field/setMinStep ...'    Set Minimum Step for G4MagIntergatorDriver 
  'field/setMinEpsilon ...' Set MinimumEpsilonStep for G4PropagatorInField
  'field/setMaxEpsilon ...' Set MaximumEpsilonStep for G4PropagatorInField
  If you use these commands after initialisation 
  you have to use command  'field/update'
