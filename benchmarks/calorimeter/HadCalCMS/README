 Simplified CMS Hadronic Calorimeter benchmark
 ---------------------------------------------

 You can find in this directory a CPU benchmark test of Geant4 
 on a simplified CMS hadronic calorimeter: 25 layers of 
 Cu(6cm)-Scintillator(4mm).

 The Physics List can be specified in the command line,
 as the second argument, e.g. :

           mainHadCalo  run1.g4  FTF_BIC

 Notice that the name of the Physics List must be in upper case, 
 exactly as the corresponding header file.
 If the Physics List is not specified, then  QGSP_BERT  is used 
 by default.

 To build the application do:   
                                make
 and you get the executable:
                                $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/mainHadCalo
 and to run it:
                                $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/mainHadCalo bench1.g4

 You can run this application with one of the following 3 macro files:
   1)  bench1.g4 : 4000 events of 50 GeV e-  without magnetic field;
   2)  bench2.g4 : 4000 events of 50 GeV pi- without magnetic field;
   3)  bench3.g4 : 4000 events of 50 GeV pi- with 4 Tesla magnetic field
                   (the field is orthogonal to the beam direction).
 In all cases, the beam particle is shot along the axis of the
 cylindrical calorimeter.

 The CPU time for each test can be obtained in different ways
 (all of these should be, more or less, in agreement):
   - Look at the value "User=..." at the end of the running,
     after the line "Run Summary": this is the total time,
     in seconds, for all (4000) events, excluding the 
     initialization.
   - Look at the value "mean = "  in one of the last lines:
     this is the average time, in seconds, for one event
     (in this case you can also see the statistical error
      of this quantity);
   - Use:
            time $G4BIN/$G4SYSTEM/mainHadCalo bench1.g4
     when launching the program: you would get, at the end
     of the program, the value: "user ..."  which is the 
     total time for all (4000) events, including the 
     initialization.
  
 To get more information that can help understanding the time
 result, it is convenient to look at the total number of 
 tracks and steps, which is printout at the end of the program.

 Finally, notice that each of the three macro files starts
 with the same seed number (taken from the file  start.rndm ),
 so if you run twice in the same machine you should get the
 same result, although the time can vary slightly due to 
 the different condition of the machine.

 ==================================================================

 In order to use this application for nightly tests, the following
 three Geant4 macro files have been added:

   1) run1.g4 : simplified ATLAS HEC calorimeter (Cu-LAr), 
                30 GeV pi-, B=2T, 1 event.
   
   2) run2.g4 : simplified ATLAS Tile calorimeter (Fe-Sci) at 90 degrees,
                30 GeV pi-, B=3T, 1 event.

   3) run3.g4 : simplified PbWO4,
                30 GeV pi-, B=4T, 1 event.
